        <n>Hej World!</n>

      <p>
        <n>My name is Auriane and you just landed in what started as a spark of passion while I was listening to a talk called "The Art of Statistics" <i>(check my first chronicle)</i>.
          I felt compelled to create a space where I could share/write my thoughts, burning questions and learning journey as I engage with critical data analysis
          through various social and environmental justice lenses. You can learn more about my vision and the multidisciplinary perspectives that I'll engage
          with in the About section. <i> - Oh and this is me  bellow, I thought that you might want to see the face behind The Data Chronicles, as
          I think it is so important today to take responsibility for the power of our words and to remember the human side of data! - </i></n>
